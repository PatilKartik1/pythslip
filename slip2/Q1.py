'''Write a Python program to get the 4th element from front and 4th element from last of a 
tuple.'''


# Define a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Get the 4th element from the front
fourth_front = my_tuple[3]

# Get the 4th element from the end
fourth_end = my_tuple[-4]

# Print the results
print("4th element from the front:", fourth_front)
print("4th element from the end:", fourth_end)
